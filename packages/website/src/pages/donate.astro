				Hey! I'm Cynthia, the developer of PronounDB. I make PronounDB on my spare free time, and have been
				maintaining it since September 2020. While I'm super happy to make it and to help folks out there,
				running PronounDB is not free and the servers unfortunately don't pay for themselves.
			</p>
			<p class='mb-2'>
				You can help me out with that, by donating. Donations allow me to pay for servers, and to pay for the
				hundreds of hours of work I put in making PronounDB. I've enjoyed every hour of it, but for the most
				part this has been free work I don't get anything for in return.
			</p>
			<p>
				Donations also go beyond PronounDB. I make a lot of <Link href='https://cynthia.dev'>other things</Link>
				which you can also support by donating. 🥺

		As a token of gratitude, donators get additional decorations they can use. There are 3 permanent donator
		decorations, and 3 additional decorations people who donate monthly can use while they're subscribed.

		You can donate via GitHub Sponsors only at this time (this will require a GitHub account). Make sure to have
		your GitHub account linked to PronounDB, so I can give you access to the decorations.
		<i>The process is not automated at this time, so it might get me a few hours or more to get them activated.</i>
