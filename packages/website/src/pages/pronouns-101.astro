		Unsure what all this pronouns stuff means? Here's a small guide that hopefully will help getting you started.
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>What are pronouns?</h2>
	<p class='mb-6'>
		Pronouns are part of our everyday language, and constitutes a whole part of someone's identity. Just like you call
		people by their name, when it's time to substitute their name for a pronoun, you should use this person's pronouns.
		Everyone has pronouns, aligned or not with their gender, and using the correct ones is important.
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>What does "x/y" means?</h2>
	<p class='mb-1'>
		For single pronouns like he/him or she/her, these are quite straightforward. However, some people may have multiple
		preferred pronouns, in which case PronounDB will use a compact form of <i>compound pronouns</i>.
	</p>
	<p class='mb-4'>
		Here's an example: if one person goes by the pronouns of she/her or it/its, PronounDB will show this as she/it.
	</p>
	<h3 class='text-md font-bold mb-2'>What's the difference between "x/y" and "y/x"?</h3>
	<p class='mb-1'>
		Generally, it is an order of preference. Someone going by "she/it" is fine having either set applied on them, but
		prefers in this case "she". If it was "it/she", it'd be the opposite.
	</p>
	<p class='mb-4'>
		Beware, <b>this is not a generality</b>. Some would want to be called <i>a bit of both</i>, some simply don't care
		and don't prefer one over the other and just like both sets equally. Make sure to ask if you're unsure!
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Further reading</h2>
	<p class='mb-1'>
		<Link href='https://en.pronouns.page/pronouns'>Pronouns.page's popular pronouns list page</Link> is a great
		resource and includes information about how to use pronouns.
	</p>
	<p class='italic'>
		Tip: PronounDB's compound pronouns are expressed as x&amp;y on pronouns.page. e.g.: PronounDB's she/it would be
		she&amp;it on pronouns.page.
