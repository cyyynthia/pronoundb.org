	<p class='mb-2'>
		Thank you for installing the extension! You'll finally no longer have to go through the trouble of reminding
		pronouns for every single person you see on the Internet! Amazing!
	</p>
	<p class='mb-2'>
		Whenever you interact with someone who uses PronounDB, you'll see their pronouns show up, so you know how to
		refer to that person. It'll also show up on people's profiles, so you can lookup people's pronouns easily.
	</p>
	<p class='mb-6'>
		Feeling unsure about what pronouns are about? Make sure to give the <Link href='/pronouns-101'>Pronouns 101</Link>
		guide a look!
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Share your own pronouns</h2>
	<p class='mb-6'>
		You can let other people know your pronouns by {authenticated
			? <Link href='/me'>going to your account</Link>
			: <><Link href='/login'>logging in</Link> or <Link href='/register'>creating an account</Link></>
		}, linking your accounts, and pick the sets of pronouns you'd like people to use on you. They'll then be able to
		know how to refer to you as well!
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Spread the word!</h2>
	<p class='mb-6'>
		This extension is only useful if people use it! The more people use it, the less people will be hesitant or
		do mistakes about your pronouns!
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Rate the extension</h2>
	<p class='mb-6'>
		Enjoying the extension? You can leave a review on your extension store to let me know you're appreciating
		it. <Heart/>
	</p>

	<h2 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Feeling generous?</h2>
	<p>
		If you wish, you can <Link href='https://ko-fi.com/cyyynthia'>donate</Link> so I can buy enough cookies and coffee
		to stay alive! Donations help paying for the hosting of the website, which isn't free, unlike the extension! 🥰
