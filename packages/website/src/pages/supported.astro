    PronounDB aims to support as many platforms as possible, so pronouns can easily be shared and changed everywhere by just a few clicks. Here's the full list of platforms supported by PronounDB:
  </div>
  <PlatformGrid>
    {platformsWithIntegration.map((platform) => (
      <Platform color={platform.color}>
        <Fragment>{platform.name}{platform.via && <span class='font-normal'> (via {platform.via})</span>}</Fragment>
        <Fragment slot='icon' set:html={platform.icon}/>
        <span slot='sub'>No preview available</span>
      </Platform>
    ))}
  </PlatformGrid>

  <h2 class='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Platforms without integrations</h2>
  <p class='mb-4'>
    While PronounDB's browser extension doesn't support these directly, these platforms are listed for third party
    developers to make cool integrations with PronounDB via the <Link href='/docs'>API</Link>.
  </p>
  <PlatformGrid>
    {platformsWithoutIntegration.map((platform) => (
      <Platform color={platform.color}>
        <Fragment>{platform.name}{platform.via && <span class='font-normal'> (via {platform.via})</span>}</Fragment>
        <Fragment slot='icon' set:html={platform.icon}/>
      </Platform>
    ))}
  </PlatformGrid>
</Layout>
